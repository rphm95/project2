This repository contains a full stack web application created using Node.js and Express connected to a MongoDb database. It was deployed using Heroku. 

This web application allows the user to keep track of destinations they would like to visit. The destination page contains a detailed infomation about the place, such as image, introductory description, hotel price, flight price, link to book a flight and also, option to add touristc attractions available on that destination.

The attractions are linked in the destination page, this was achieved by creating a relationship between destination and attractions models. This relationship with different databases allows the user to display, add, edit and delete specific information about the sight they plan to visit without affecting the destination infomation.
